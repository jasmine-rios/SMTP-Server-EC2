## Installation-Steps-Click-Ops

Use this to install a test SMTP server in the AWS console. Information on SMTP ports to use was found at (Cloudflare SMTP Breakdown)[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-smtp/]. 

Ideally for real SMTP don't have these SMTP ports open anywhere but narrow it down with the Networks that it's going to send it with.
